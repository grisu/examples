This example uses the Grisu-Jython library to process several files simultaneously by submitting
them to a BeSTGRID cluster as a batch job.

In the input directory are several text files containing random words generated by Bacon Ipsum 
http://baconipsum.com

Bacon Ipsum was set for 5 paragraphs of Meat and Filler, with "Start with ‘Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet…’" turned on.

There are two scripts:
countbacon.py	- this script reads two file counts all occurrences of the words in the
				first file (the dictionary) in the second file (the input). Output is sent to stdout. 
submitbacon.py	- this script uses Grisu-jython to create a batch job for each file in the input directory
				and submit them to a compute resource on BeSTGRID to be counted with countbacon.py. The output
				is downloaded and copied into the output directory.
