This example uses the Grisu-Jython library to process several files simultaneously by submitting
them to a BeSTGRID cluster as a batch job.

In the input directory are several text files containing random words generated by Bacon Ipsum 
http://baconipsum.com

Bacon Ipsum was set for 5 paragraphs of Meat and Filler, with "Start with ‘Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet…’" turned on.

There are two scripts:
countbacon.py	- this script takes two file names as arguments and counts all occurrences of the words in the
				first file (the dictionary) in the second file (the input). Output is sent to stdout. 
submitbacon.py	- this script uses Grisu-jython to create a batch job for each file in the input directory
				and submit them to a compute resource on BeSTGRID to be counted with countbacon.py. The output
				is downloaded and copied into the output directory.
